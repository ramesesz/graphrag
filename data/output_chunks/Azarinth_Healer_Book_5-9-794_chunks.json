With the war in Lys at a stalemate, refugees, merchants, and\ncraftspeople looking for safety and distance from the ongoing conflict were\nfinding a new home in the fortress city of the Shadow\u2019s Hand.\nWith all the equipment and gold from the vaults of Rhyvor added to the\ncoffers of the city, Ilea and Claire laid the foundations for what was to\ncome. An independent Ravenhall with its own guard and council, perhaps\neven its own healing organization.\nHer friends and allies were hard at work, so Ilea went to check in on\nRiverwatch, the first settlement she\u2019d found when she arrived on Elos. Her\njourney led her to a rematch with a demon she had fought some time ago\nand an investigation into the underbelly of Riverwatch. She met and trained\nwith a group of elves that were part of the Cerithil Hunters, elves who had\nforsaken their domains to go into dungeons and fight the machines left\nbehind by the Taleen dwarves, machines that Ilea is very familiar with.\nBefore she could go back to Ravenhall, Ilea was called to help in the\nnorth, where a corruption had started spreading amongst the monsters of the\nDescent. Frenzied creatures were coming up to the first layer of the ancient\ndungeon and endangering the settlers and scavengers that lived there.\nShe was joined by a group of powerful friends and allies, and they dove\ninto the unknown to find the source of the corruption and the fate of the\nexpedition that had gone into the dungeon before. Countless monster battles\nand days of resistance training finally brought Ilea to the 20th layer, where\nboth she and her allies battled and defeated the corrupted Sand Elemental",

At the bottom of the facility, Ilea helped drain and\ndisperse a large amount of gathered mana before she learned that the\nancient facilities within the dungeon had once belonged to the Ascended,\nbeings from another realm that had come to Elos with an unknown purpose.\nWhen Ilea and Violence looked for answers within an enchanted device,\nthey found out that the facility was not abandoned at all. An Ascended\nnamed Vor Elenthir appeared and confronted Ilea, nearly killing her in the\nensuing battle.\nShe escaped with the help of Violence and was invited to its home,\nwhere she learned the true nature of the Fae.

There were hundreds of\npeople around \u2013 merchants, workers, civilians, guards, and adventurers\nequipped with armor, robes, staffs, swords, and other weapons.

The nearby mountains were still topped with snow, but she\ncould tell that spring was on the horizon.\nShe felt a deep calm settle within her as she looked out onto the square\nand the alleys beyond.

Such things\ndidn\u2019t surprise him anymore.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s weird though?\u201d Nathan asked. \u201cEvery store, inn,\nand restaurant associated with the name Lilith is well-run and generally of\ngood quality.

We\u2019re not that different, are we?\n\u201cThis is my arm,\u201d Ilea said, holding the severed limb with her\nremaining one. \u201cYou might notice my lack of concern. There are skills that\nreduce pain. The main one is a general skill called Pain Tolerance. If a skill\nreaches level twenty and levels once again, it advances to the second tier.\n\u201cThe benefit of Pain Tolerance in the second tier is the complete\nremoval of pain. Should I choose to do so. I won\u2019t force any of you to\nacquire this skill, but the benefits are extraordinary.\u201d\nShe waved at the group with her severed arm.\n\u201cThis is quite a problem, isn\u2019t it? And the pain that I turned off would be\ntelling me this. I was injured. My arm taken. I can\u2019t hold my weapon, I\ncan\u2019t concentrate on my spell because of the pain. I will bleed out soon. If I\nsurvive, the wound might get infected. If I can\u2019t find a capable healer in a\ncouple days, I will lose my arm forever.\n\u201cNow, watch,\u201d she said before looking at the wound. Close to her\nshoulder, tissue reformed at an insane speed, bone, muscle, and skin, until\nher hand closed once more into a fist.\n\u201cI still ruined one of my shirts, but you get the idea,\u201d Lilith said and\ntossed the severed arm behind her.",

The difficulty was in simultaneously providing encouragement,\nmonitoring pain, and taking care of the people who lost consciousness.\nShe stopped after the two hours were up, mostly because she wanted to\ntry out some other things. Now that was a success, she thought as she piled\nup the severed limbs, replenishing the corruption she had used up with fresh\nooze. Activating Heart of Cinder, she disintegrated everything that remained\nof the vile substance.\n\u201cCheck your clothes, each other\u2019s clothes, the ground around you, your\nhair, or anywhere else where corruption might remain. I don\u2019t have to tell\nyou how deadly and dangerous it is. Be thorough,\u201d Ilea said, checking too\nwith both her eyes and her sphere.\nNobody spoke as they carefully looked each other over.

I should\nreally know these names by now.\n\u201cGood. We\u2019ll continue with ash magic,\u201d Ilea said.\nThe Fae had given her a few tips on how to potentially get her Sentinels\na Class that resembled her own. Ash was a big part of it.

Floating bridges\nled toward two platforms at its center. Each had what looked like a circular\nteleportation platform, known as a gate, built onto them.

More interesting than sitting here,\u201d Luke said,\nlooking at Ford.\nThe man glanced at the group and nodded.\nNathan smiled to himself. He wasn\u2019t obsessed with Aki. He was\nterrified of him. Terrified of what else was out there. That was why he\nwanted to face him. That was why he was here.",

Same time again tomorrow?\u201d\n\u201cYes, but I won\u2019t have as much time. Now, I\u2019m glad you found the\ndungeon to be so fruitful. Your arena training left an impression too. I\nalready had the rewards for tomorrow lowered based on the flood of\ninterest. I\u2019ll be excluding the elements you mentioned.

What of it?\u201d\n\u201cIt seems the economic stress put on the city because of the elven\nattacks has finally caused too much tension. A group of rebels has turned on\nthe nobles, supported by a large part of the populace as well as adventurers.\nIt wouldn\u2019t have been possible if a large part of the previous nobility hadn\u2019t\nfled eastward after the initial attacks.\u201d\nIlea nodded. \u201cWhat about the Corinth Order? Isn\u2019t it based there?\u201d\n\u201cMany of its members relocated to Nipha and Kroll in the wake of the\nelven attacks. I\u2019m keeping an eye on the situation amongst the healing\norders to make sure the Medic Sentinels aren\u2019t blindsided by the\ndevelopments. Currently, they\u2019re more focused on each other. The Corinth\nOrder themselves might even try to retake Dawntree.\n\u201cRiverwatch, on the other hand, had some success in rescuing and\ntaking in ex-slaves who fled the Empire\u2019s war. I received a letter earlier\ntoday saying they\u2019re expanding downward. We lent them a number of our\nbest architects and engineers. Large sums of gold too \u2013 mostly from you.\u201d\n\u201cSounds like you have your hands in a lot of things.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m doing my best,\u201d Claire said and smiled.\n\u201cDone!\u201d Cless showed off her newest creation.

It was just as moldy and overgrown as the rest. A few\nglowing mushrooms illuminated the parts she could see. Still, it was far\nbigger than anything she had seen so far and a little more intact.\nA town hall, maybe? Or a temple?\nTwo Golems were guarding the main entrance. Luckily, the large double\ndoors were made of stone, otherwise they would have rotted away.\nIlea blinked twice and left her entourage behind, appearing in a hall\ndimly lit by mushrooms glowing a pale blue. Enough for her enhanced eyes\nto see the surroundings.\nMuch of the furniture that once adorned this place had joined the\ngrowth, but she found at least a dozen skeletons, most of them buried and\nhalf-rotten within the fungi.\nArranged in a circle? Around this? she thought as she looked over at the\nsarcophagus in the center of the hall. Runes and glyphs unfamiliar to her\ncovered the overgrown stone.\nHer sphere informed her that a person remained inside. Neither a\nskeleton nor void of magic.

She finished\nher hot chocolate with closed eyes, uncaring about the scalding heat\npouring down her throat. Some of it was absorbed by her third-tier Heat\nResistance to provide some warmth.\nHeart of Cinder could certainly be used to absorb excess heat as well,\nbut Ilea currently didn\u2019t have a way to get rid of the spell safely once\nactivated. And she didn\u2019t plan on sending a beacon of bright energy up into\nthe sky, especially with the flying guards and birds.\nShe left several gold pieces to pay the two hundred and ninety silver\npiece bill. The waitress tried to reassure her that payment wasn\u2019t necessary,\nbut Ilea had already vanished.\nOnce you\u2019re rich and influential, you apparently don\u2019t have to pay for\nanything anymore, she thought with a smirk. As if it was an affront to ask\nthe famous Lilith to pay for services or goods provided. Ridiculous.\nJerry, the arena attendant who had replaced Lyza, looked relieved when Ilea\nfinally showed up, his expression quickly turning to fear as he approached\nher.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Jerry?\u201d she asked with a smile, ignoring the looks\nfrom dozens of people hanging around in the arena.\nSome of them were trailing the attendant, but their questions died down\nas soon as they spotted Ilea.\n\u201cAh\u2026 yes. Greetings, my lady,\u201d the attendant replied. \u201cErm\u2026 it seems\nword of the session from yesterday has done the rounds. I\u2019m nearly done\nwith categorizing. Claire informed me to lower the rewards from five silver\nper hour to two. Nobody left after the announcement, so I suggest we lower\nit further tomorrow. Would that be agreeable to you?\u201d\n\u201cSure.\u201d\nIlea covered herself with ash. She thanked the man and went into the\narena, walking past the people who stepped away at her approach.",

And its various uses in alchemy and other sectors make it\ngenerally less profitable to sell to the few armorers that are interested.\n\u201cI doubt my capabilities are enough to produce full-fledged armor, but\nperhaps if I work together with a smith, we could figure something out.\nMetal is easier to come by, however, especially if you are looking for a\nuniform design,\u201d he explained. \u201cDid you have a creature in mind that you\ncould hunt for its bones?\u201d\n\u201cI see.

I don\u2019t want to\nequip the Sentinels with sub-par gear.\u201d\n\u201cNo, no. You shouldn\u2019t underestimate bone. We would have to test\nyours, but seeing how powerful you\u2019ve gotten, I think it will be more than\nsuitable. Bone is generally far easier to enchant and is naturally more\nresilient against many schools of magic than most kinds of steel, notably\nagainst mana intrusion.\n\u201cI think it would be both suitable and fitting. Depending on how easy it\nis to create armor, given the ease of access to new materials, they\u2019ll be able\nto train with it without any worries about damaging it.\u201d\n\u201cAwesome, now I\u2019m getting excited,\u201d she said with a smile.",

She found hunting parties and soldiers, lone\nadventurers, and even a few farms.\nWhen she reached the mountainous area indicated on the map, Ilea\ndecided to land near a campfire partially hidden between a group of large\nboulders.

It\u2019s quite useful. Especially to create a diversion and escape,\u201d Ilea\nsaid with a smile. It wasn\u2019t technically a lie.\n\u201cI can imagine that.

Sophia had considered whether the\nnewcomer\u2019s level could be as high as she claimed, but the notion was so\nridiculous she dismissed it. Not because a healer of that level wasn\u2019t a\npossibility, but simply because someone like that wouldn\u2019t join a random\ngroup of adventurers they came across in the Kroll mountains.\nThey would be an influential figure, a noble, the head of a healing order,\nor perhaps a high-ranking mercenary or adventurer.

A level two hundred and four warrior.\nHe was tall, over two meters. His gear had to weigh as much as or more\nthan the man himself. A large sword was strapped to his back, the form\nreminding her of a katana, but its size was closer to that of a greatsword. It\nwas two meters or more in length as well and currently sheathed.\nHis armor was made of black steel, dents and scratches telling a story of\ntheir own. Four horns adorned his helmet, and two small sockets showed\nthe eyes behind. Simple, brown eyes.\nIlea evaluated the others, but they were all below two hundred, and\nnone of their skills were new to her. She suspected that the majority of them\nsimply overestimated their abilities or didn\u2019t believe the stories of those\nwho had already participated in the arena.\nThe large Shadow looked at the waiting group and spoke. \u201cCover your\nears.\u201d\nHe then focused on Ilea, took a deep breath, and shouted.\nShe felt the power reverberate through the hall, hitting her as if it were a\nwall of stone.\nSound magic\u2026 That\u2019s good.

Following your intervention with the smugglers and your\nfindings, we have persecuted and exiled quite a few previously high-\nstanding nobility, merchants, adventurers, and all manner of personnel in\nthe city.\n\u201cTo prevent chaos and potentially open warfare within the city, we\nopted not to outright attack many of the corrupt parties and traitors. We\nwere aware of the potential incentive for vengeance, but perhaps we\nunderestimated their resolve and connections. Are you aware of the current\nstate of Baralia?\u201d\nIlea sipped her tea. \u201cI know that the siege around Virilya was broken\nand that the Empire is now pushing into the lands of Baralia.\u201d\nHe nodded. \u201cExactly, which has put a lot of pressure on every\ninfluential figure and Order in the Kingdom. To put it bluntly, they\u2019re\npanicked and scared shitless. King Baron is trying to hold onto whatever\npower he can, but as far as we understand, his reach doesn\u2019t extend far",

The latter was bloodied, but he was holding his own.\nIlea looked for the supposed leader of this camp. She didn\u2019t have to look\nparticularly hard.\nLuis Harken was sitting on a large throne-like chair, one leg resting on\nthe other and a satisfied smirk on his face. He waved a hand, and the\nmuscular soldier who was fighting grinned, unsheathing the sword on his\nbelt.\nAsh flowed out from Ilea\u2019s back as she stepped forward, pushing past\nsome of the soldiers as her armor moved into place. She watched as the\nmassive soldier advanced on his weaponless foe, the result now a forgone\nconclusion.\nShe could see the fear and anger in the eyes of the unarmored, red-\nhaired fighter. She smiled when he raised his fists anyway to fight one last\ntime.\nIt wouldn\u2019t come to that. When the behemoth soldier charged with his\nsword raised, his compatriots cheering him on, Ilea appeared between the\ntwo fighters. She caught the blade with her bare hand and held it there.\nThe cheers turned to boos and confused shouts. Some of the crowd were\nstill laughing, while others were calling the big soldier names now that he\nhad become the victim.\nIlea grabbed his cuirass and pulled the large man closer. She took the\nsword from his hand, held it for a moment, and then rammed it up under his\nchin. The blade went through his skull, exiting the top of his head. His\nenormous body went limp, but she held his corpse there for a long moment\nas the crowd around her quieted.\nLuis looked on with interest. He was classically handsome, with curly\nbrown hair, unblemished skin, and a strong jaw. He wore armor trimmed in\ngold and held an ornate sword on his lap.

Ya lookin\u2019 for a strong team?!\u201d a very loud patron called\nout to her. He was a stout man with bulging biceps and a pot belly. His ear\nhair was long enough that he could probably braid it.\n[Warrior \u2013 lvl 68]\nAdventurers of Elos indeed, she thought, joining one of the lines.\n\u201cDidn\u2019t ya hear me?\u201d the hairy man called out again.\n\u201cLeave her be,\u201d one of the man\u2019s party hissed, a lithe rogue at a similar\nlevel, who pulled the hairy man away. \u201cYou don\u2019t wanna insult the Orders.\u201d\nBefore Ilea could turn away, someone else walked up to her and\nintroduced himself.",

Two hundred?\n\u201cSure, whatever the equivalent of this is,\u201d she said, summoning her\nShadow badge and placing it on the counter.\nAsher opened and closed his mouth before taking a step back.\nThe woman behind the counter gave her a look and checked the badge.\n\u201cThis is real. Are you sure you want an adventurer\u2019s badge? This one\nshould be more effective in almost all cases.\u201d\nIlea considered it and then smiled. \u201cYeah, I\u2019d like to have one.\u201d\nMight be useful for my adventuring persona.

The attendant could, however,\npinpoint the area where Ilea\u2019s caravan had last encountered the creature on\na map.\nA few skeletons showed that she had found the right place.

He had lost a dozen guards already. Men and women he knew well,\nwhom he had trained, fought, and eaten with. He had called her here, but\neverything that happened now was on them.\n\u201cTen minutes\u2026 she can\u2019t be serious,\u201d the governor whispered. \u201cWe\ncan\u2019t engage\u2026 even with her on our side, it would be suicide.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s told me stories you wouldn\u2019t believe.

As long as the whole battle healer thing\ndidn\u2019t become broadly known. I hope the first Sentinels get their Classes\nsoon. That might solve that issue.\nThe house was more basic than she had expected. Not small, but the\narchitecture was simple. Stone blocks creating a cottage-like structure that\nwould be big enough for an inn in smaller towns, a simple, thatched roof,\nand some practical wooden window shutters. It was large enough to house a\nfamily, but it certainly didn\u2019t look like it would be home to a captain of the\nguard.\nThe door, however, was reinforced with steel and half a foot thick. In\nher sphere, she noted a mechanism allowing a heavy iron bar to be slid into\nplace behind it by pulling a lever.\nDecent security. Wouldn\u2019t do much against me, but still decent.\nThe door opened slightly, green eyes staring out from behind the\nsecurity chains still in place. \u201cYes?\u201d the woman asked.\n\u201cHello.

She was a little smaller than Ilea and had a delicate stature.\n\u201cI\u2019m Abby, come on in,\u201d she said, welcoming the guest before she\nwalked to the kitchen, leaving Ilea in the entryway.\nIt was a simple stone and wood affair, but a rich, multi-colored rug had\nbeen laid on the floor, and various candles gave off an inviting glow.

I didn\u2019t expect you to enjoy the consequences.\u201d\n\u201cOld rules and old powers led my parents into ruin. And me to run and\nhide in Ravenhall, even after I became a Shadow. Of course I\u2019d enjoy a\nlittle chaos.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the last sentence I thought I\u2019d ever hear from you.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve learned that chaos can lead to opportunities, as unpleasant as\nit is at first. And with everyone holding on to the status quo, it\u2019s difficult to\nshake things up for the better. That\u2019s why we work so well together, Ilea.\nBut I don\u2019t plan to get in over my head, and I suggest, as always, that you\ndon\u2019t either.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m making no promises,\u201d Ilea said.\nThey had nearly met their end facing the Birmingales. She knew how\ndangerous other people could be, and while things had changed with her\nfast increase in power, the fame, or perhaps infamy, now attributed to her\nname could balance things out. They didn\u2019t know how many level three,\nfour, or even five hundred people were out there, and while they likely\nhadn\u2019t cared much about some random Shadow in the south before, they\nmay care now.\nIt may be time to get to three-fifty and see what I unlock. I may need\neverything I can get my hands on soon.\n\u201cI hear the first Sentinels have been sent into dungeons. Any Classes\nyet?\u201d\nIlea shook her head. \u201cNone as of yet. But with how well they\u2019re doing\nout there, it\u2019s only a matter of time.\u201d\n\u201cI hope you\u2019re not pushing them too far. I checked some of those\ndungeons, and the monster levels are far too high for them to handle.\u201d\nIlea smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s the point. Besides, I\u2019m there to watch over them.\u201d\n\u201cI hope there are results soon. With your intervention in Riverwatch,",

How do they hold up?\u201d\nThe man smiled, his booming laugh rolling through the massive forge.\nNot the usual forge she had visited in the past but a larger one. It was still in\nMorhill, though, the city the Shadows had cleared before retaking\nRavenhall from the demons. One of the Ravenhall council\u2019s projects was to\nrebuild and repopulate the city to make it something akin to a buffer zone\nbetween them and the Empire.\nIlea wasn\u2019t entirely sure what role exactly Balduur filled in the town,\nbut the large repurposed warehouse now held enough forges, materials, and\nstorage to provide dozens of smiths with a space to work to then supply\nhundreds, if not more, fighters, guards, and adventurers.\n\u201cThe Stonehammer steel you provided is quite durable.

The bones are quite durable too.\nNot quite as strong as the steel, but they\u2019re more flexible, so I used them\nwhere they can provide more mobility without losing too much protection. I\nthink the result is a good mix.\n\u201cI did want to ask something, though,\u201d the smith added with a frown. \u201cI\nwatched Orthan work, and it\u2019s clear that the bones are human.

Made to be light and\nquiet. Very little steel had been used on this one, only in places that\nprotected the heart, head, and spine.\nIt looked deadly.\nBut so did all of them. The armor had been made to be both distinct and\neffective. Balduur and Orthan based them all on the measurements and\nfighting preferences of every Sentinel, and soon, the first of them would\nreceive their set.\nThey had grown from scared and desperate refugees or aspiring\nadventurers without means to capable fighters.

Both in how\nmuch mana it used up and how quickly the object was affected.\n\u201cI assume it\u2019s the same problem that applies to teleporting out of\nsomeone\u2019s grasp.

You could teleport\nsingle monsters to you to lure them more easily, depending on the range.

She looked down\nand saw the half-eaten deer. \u201cAn impressive catch,\u201d she murmured.\nThe monster opened its jaws and closed them around her head, biting\ndown hard against her ashen armor.\nIlea could hear the teeth grinding against her ash. She used Force to\nslow the creature, grabbing its jaws and slowly pulling them open with her\nhands.\nDisplacement moved the Drake back a few meters as she summoned\none of Keyla\u2019s meals.\nShe smiled when she saw the creature running away.\nFinally got it.\nThe Drake was at level twenty, barely even a danger to most guards and\nadventurers. Their size could still be troublesome, she supposed.\nAnd now I have a new Class.\nShe quickly flew to the temple and landed on it.\nMaybe once I improve my space magic, there will be a way to return\nhome. See how things are going back on Earth.\nThe compass rose remained where she had carved it.\nA new world, hmm? Well, we\u2019ll see what else I discover here. Got\nanother set of old acquaintances to meet first.\nIlea spread her wings once more and blinked up and above the tree line.\nWith her new target in sight, she flew off toward Karth.

Judging by her low level, that\nassumption was likely true. Her hair was brown, weaved into a single braid\nthat hung down past her shoulder. It looked hastily done.\nShe had dark brown skin, her green eyes downright striking due to the\ncontrast. She was smaller than Ilea in both size and height.\n\u201cWhat do you want to eat?\u201d Ilea asked.\nA stranded lone healer lost in a city with a recently changed\ngovernment.

Lots\nof people around who we can share with. Two, then.\u201d\nHe chuckled. \u201cTwo it is. Can I ask you to pay upfront?\u201d\nIlea summoned a piece of gold and placed it down on the counter. \u201cIs\nthat enough?\u201d\n\u201cMore than enough.\u201d",

I was\nchosen simply because I had a talent for healing and a keen mind. That\u2019s\nwhat they told me, anyway. I didn\u2019t know they leveraged my healing for\npolitical influence and gold. At least at first,\u201d she admitted.\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re here now. Any plans for the future?\u201d\n\u201cThe Corinth Order isn\u2019t gone. They\u2019ve just been removed from\nDawntree.

You can come and watch if you want,\u201d Ilea said, blinking to one\nof the clerks to rent the training hall.\nIt was a fairly easy process, and they were soon standing in a simple\nroom with bare stone walls and a floor covered in hard sand.\n\u201cI assume you\u2019ve found your Class to be quite good.

Time.\u201d\n\u201cWith world-shattering information or artifacts,\u201d Ilea retorted.\n\u201cThat just makes it worse,\u201d Claire said and sighed. \u201cHow do you like\nyour resistance-training-free days?\u201d\nIlea took a bite of the bun, chewed, and swallowed. \u201cIt\u2019s quite relaxing,\nactually. Feels a little like a vacation. Experimenting with new skills is quite\ninteresting too. And I\u2019m so close to a breakthrough with that damn armor, I\ncan feel it.\u201d\n\u201cThe armor from your smith in the north?\u201d\n\u201cMhm,\u201d Ilea said and continued eating, gesturing for the woman to help\nherself. \u201cIt\u2019s like a puzzle.\u201d\nClaire took a plate, piling some bacon, cheese, grapes, and bread onto it.\n\u201cAppreciate it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re enjoying yourself. However, it\nseems the world won\u2019t simply let Lilith train peacefully in her favorite\ncity.\u201d\nShe summoned a letter. The paper itself looked expensive, but what\ncaught Ilea\u2019s eyes was the golden seal.\nA lily.\nIlea formed a small dome of ash just in case the thing was some sort of\nassassination attempt.\nClaire chuckled a little at that.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Ilea asked, opening the letter with an ashen limb.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Claire said, drinking some juice.\nIlea took out the letter and looked at it. \u201cDo you want to hear?\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Claire activated a few runed plates and casually threw\nthem around the table.

The poison pulsated at regular\nintervals, faint black veins showing on her arms as the heat intensified the\nvarious flavors in the hellish chocolate creation. The pain was subdued, a\nslight itch to enhance the rest. It felt both confusing and heavenly.\nIlea sat there, enjoying the cake, her eyes closed so as not to distract her\nfrom the sensation. She was awoken from her reverie by Helena\u2019s joyous\nlaughter.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cYou liked it?\u201d the woman asked, smiling wide.\nIlea gave her a long look. \u201cI might need to ask you for the recipe.\u201d\n\u201cA secret.

She wanted to know why he had done it.\nAnd then she wanted to kill him.\nNow they had an independent Ravenhall with a nearly united Shadow\u2019s\nHand, a newly founded healing order training young and driven battle\nhealers, and a council headed by Sulivhaan and Dagon, two people she\u2019d\nhoped would never move into the foreground.\nShould have had them killed when I had the chance. She shook her\nhead. Her own ambitions and history with the Hand wouldn\u2019t get in the way\nof stability.\nThe recent developments in the south would change things. And there\nwas too much change as it was.\nShe would focus her efforts on the Empire and Alyris. Once this war\nwas over and the dust had settled, Lys would be more powerful than ever\nbefore. She had to commend the young Empress, as much as it annoyed her.\nHelena hoped that Ilea would prove herself in Baralia. Perhaps some\nexperience fighting alongside some of the older members would temper her.",

If there is nothing to gain, we will move deeper into the\ncountry.\u201d\nHe pointed at a map. \u201cFirst to Nara, and then onward as we see fit.\nThere are other strike teams working with the same target in mind, most",

Let\u2019s try and find out something about this ritual.\nShe continued teleporting through cellars, checking the vicinity through\nher sphere. Most houses looked pretty packed, with people sleeping,\ncooking, playing games, or working. Now that she was off the streets, it\ndidn\u2019t feel so different from Ravenhall or Riverwatch, just very packed,\npoorer, and with the threat of war looming over their heads.\nMost people seemed frustrated and desperate, but she saw a lot of care\nand tenderness as well, a lot of working hard to take care of each other even\nthough the situation was difficult.\nAppearing at the edge of a large square, she saw a bunch of merchants\nselling their wares and a few selling people.

In a world where literally everyone could wield magic, could\nwork to increase the power of their Class, it just felt so bleak to see\nsomething so obviously evil as slavery. To take even the last shred of\nagency from someone.\nShe switched into more casual clothes from her necklace and then\nteleported. She sat down next to a few people who were watching the\nsquare. Their clothing looked worn, and they had blisters on their hands and\nfeet.\nIt was strange to be here. Exploring Riverwatch or any of the other\ncities she\u2019d been to had always been exciting.

Because of the power she wielded. She\ncould go up to the slave traders and simply kill them all. But then, she\nwould traumatize everyone else here. The slaves would be killed if the\nsoldiers found out. She would have to transport them out of the country.\nAt least I would give them a chance.\nMaybe she would have done something. But if the Order of Truth found\nout they were here, they might accelerate their plans.\n\u201cYou seem troubled,\u201d an older man sitting close to her said.

If you take a Class or level too much, others might take notice.\n\u201cSure, if you\u2019re not a slave, you can go out there into the wilderness or\njoin the army, but a lot of risk comes with that.

Probably a bit of both, mixed with Nicholas\u2019s knowledge of what\nsome of his colleagues and superiors were capable of.\n\u201cI will protect you all if I can, but I\u2019m not the leader of this operation,\u201d\nIlea said when they rounded another corner, getting closer to the meeting\npoint.\nA member of the Dawn Company intercepted them shortly after, giving\nthem a long look before she nodded at Ilea.\nA few minutes later, they were with the others. Hector wasn\u2019t there. Nor\nwas Velamyr\u2019s group, which resulted in a few minutes of tense waiting\nbefore the latter group showed up.\nGeneral Ryse looked at Ilea\u2019s group and then at her.\n\u201cI looked around the city, talked to some people, and got a tip,\u201d Ilea\nsaid. \u201cThis here is Nicholas, acolyte of the Order of Truth.

Solid rock walls pressed in from all sides.\nEverything here looked a little cleaner than upstairs. Statues of various\ncreatures lined the corridor\u2019s walls. A few torches lit the passage, flickering\nfrom time to time.\nFive massive stone arches framed the length of the passage, evenly\nspaced out. They would have to pass under each arch to reach the other\nside. A sealed stone gate lay at the end of the ominous hallway.\n\u201cThe presence is beyond that gate,\u201d Ilea said.\n\u201cIt looks ceremonial,\u201d Felicia said.\nIlea tried to establish a connection.

I merely placed him close to the exit,\u201d\nMeadow said. \u201cAnd I will continue to do so if he attacks the others.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, probably a good idea to keep an eye on him. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s\nused to being around people more powerful than him. I\u2019ll check on the\nsurvivors and bring them down here. I assume just to the base level and not\ndeeper into these tunnels?\u201d\n\u201cYes. The mana density is too high for them.\u201d\nIlea nodded and left with the sheets of stone. She looked at them and\nsmiled to herself.\nThis day is getting weirder and weirder. Not that I\u2019m complaining.\nSpace magic training from a four-mark creature? Sign me up.\nIlea appeared in front of a group of insects. She even recognized a few\nof them as the ants she had met in the throne room.\nMost of them shied back.\nShe just stood there and held up the tablets.\nThey made clicking noises, obviously arguing with one another, before\na few walked closer.\n\u201cYou understand?\u201d Ilea asked.\nThey replied in clicks. A few of them rushed out into the nearby tunnels,\nbut most remained.\nIlea turned and walked back toward the Meadow\u2019s area. They\u2019re\nfollowing me. Good.\nShe met Michael on the way, his eyes darting from her to the insects\nbehind.\nIlea cocked her head at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d",

That confirms that you gained an\nadditional Class before reaching the normally required level for Core Skill\npoints. It should also mean that the locked options will become available\nonce you reach the requisite level.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t sound sure.\u201d\n\u201cI have studied various awakened creatures since my own awakening.\nThe Pale Ones, for example, are born at level one hundred. The Horned\nBeetles, on the other hand, at one hundred and fifty. They each are given a\nsingle Class upon their birth.\n\u201cThe Rainbow Wisps were unique in that they were born without a\nClass but instead had powerful resistances to ward off the dangerous nature\nin this realm.

I assume your own kind is not given a Class upon their birth?\u201d\n\u201cYes. Why the assumption?\u201d\n\u201cYou faced several Pale Ones with two Classes and prevailed, despite\nyour level. The Queen was powerful within her species, yet she could not\nslay you. You can fight against level six and seven hundred spirits. This\nmeans your current levels are far beyond what your species usually\nachieves. Beyond the classification your level represents.\n\u201cRequirements are different depending on the species. Your kind starts\ntheir life without a Class and thus should have more variety in the abilities\nthey can choose. With your comments on the third Class, I have to assume\nyou are offered two once the mana within you has settled. And you have\nachieved a third, which should be rare for your kind.

If she couldn\u2019t avoid a spell for\nsome reason, she could use Phaseshift to mitigate some of the damage or,\ndepending on the magic type used, nullify it entirely.\nHer precognition even somewhat lowered the negative impact of the\nspell\u2019s activation time. Considering her other active skills, she made the\ndecision to keep this one. Force gave her some maneuverability and some\ndefense, but Phaseshift allowed her to potentially negate enemy attacks\nentirely. Neither skill was better per se, but Phaseshift added something\nentirely new to her arsenal.\nThe second tier didn\u2019t solve the issue of moving the survivors, though.\nThe Meadow had also let her know that Michael had no solution yet either,\nnor a place where he could move them.\nThey tried using her third-tier Displacement through the gate, but the\nspell failed to manifest in both realms at the same time. She also\ndemonstrated her third-tier Blink, which only confirmed the solid structure\nof the spell.

She called out with Monster\nHunter, using her new second-tier Deviant of Humanity to make it clear that\nthe creatures were simply no match for her.\nShe tried to grasp at what her captive felt and thought, but it remained\naggressive, trying to cut through the ash with continued vigor. The others\nhad retreated after her display, entirely uncaring for their captured friend.\nThe corpses were left behind, one still falling into the green hell below.\nIlea had outgrown these creatures, as she\u2019d expected, but she wasn\u2019t\nhere to clear the dungeon. She just needed a creature to test.\nShe looked at the struggling Drop Saurian trying to claw her face off.\nMaybe it was a pipe dream, but she had grown to like the Meadow, and if\nthere was a way to bring it here, she would give it a shot. If it wanted to, of\ncourse.\nSpace Shift allowed her to attach herself to another teleportation spell.\nAnd Displacement allowed her to move other beings. So, in theory, she\nthought it should be possible to attach another being to her long-range third\ntier of Blink, effectively bringing it with her.\nAnd if that works, then maybe, maybe there\u2019s a chance.\nThe spell activated, and she held on to the creature still trying to bite her\nface off.\nThe space around her shifted, and she appeared in her home, a smile",

As long as we find a more suitable place within a few\nweeks.\u201d\nShe nodded, more to herself than to the Meadow.\nI hope this works.\nIlea breathed in and focused. She didn\u2019t wait any longer and activated\nher third tier of Blink, feeling the power manifest, runes form, and space\ndistort.\nShe could see the intricacies of the spell, understood most of the runes\nthat she saw, could feel what they would do.\nShe saw the gaps where Displacement would slot in, where it would\nattach.\nMore and more power gathered, and as time went on, she started\nsmiling.\nThis is nowhere near as hard as some of those puzzles you had me solve.\nWhen it activated, she breathed in deep and connected the Meadow to\nher long-range teleportation ability.\nIlea appeared in her home an instant later, a ball of stone in her hands.\nShe breathed out.\n\u201cYou\u2019re here!\u201d\nNo reply came from the being.\nShe shook it lightly. \u201cHey, you alright in there? Talk to me.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u2026 yes\u2026 I\u2019m here,\u201d the Meadow exclaimed.\nIlea raised the being up. \u201cIt worked!\u201d She couldn\u2019t hide her delight as\nshe looked at the stone sphere.\n\u201cIt did.

And yes, but I can only do so every so often.\nIt would be foolish to do so in a place I do not plan to stay.\u201d\nIlea smiled, touching Meadow\u2019s stone to the tree. Then she laughed. The\nsituation just felt so absurd, and at the same time, she felt a tremendous\nsense of relief.\nThey had survived, had closed the gate, and she had brought the\nMeadow back with her.\nAnd I was part of that insane battle.

She sat next to it and sighed with joyous relief.\n\u201cWhat do you think of the mana density?\u201d she asked. \u201cDo you think you\ncould stay here?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s much, much better than your house. Not just the interior design,\nfrom a mana standpoint too,\u201d the Meadow said. \u201cMy abilities allow me to\nbe a little more flexible. Your house would have been challenging, but\neverything you\u2019ve been calling the north is perfectly reasonable. I could",

Perhaps not impossible\u2026 but I tend to be\noptimistic. I would first focus on the eight other species in the vicinity that\nshow far more promise.

I\u2019ll try not to roll off this chair and fall into the abyss\nbeyond this cathedral.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s a manageable task for a four-mark earth and space mage.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps I can finally reach the fifth tier with this challenge.\u201d\nIlea rolled her eyes and blinked up. She was glad the Meadow seemed\nto be enjoying itself. She charged her wings and made her way to\nHallowfort.\nThe guards let her pass immediately, every single one apparently\nfamiliar with her.\nGotta say, it\u2019s quite flattering.",
